 # Grassland Management Under Climate Change
Over the past 50 years, Sorghastrum nutans has exhibited a notable northward migration, reflecting the dynamic interplay between climate change and species distribution. This preliminary study delves into the intricacies of this range expansion, with a specific focus on the time periods of 1980 and 2005, within the unique context of Little Missouri National Grassland. Through an examination of factors such as precipitation, soil pH, elevation, and aspect, and climate trends during these two pivotal time points, the research aims to discern the drivers behind the observed northward movement of Sorghastrum nutans. By utilizing a multidimensional approach and leveraging advancements in ecological modeling, the study not only sheds light on the species' adaptive strategies but also provides a comparative analysis of its habitat preferences over the selected time periods. Positioned within the dynamic landscape of Little Missouri National Grassland, this research seeks to offer a nuanced understanding of Sorghastrum nutans' response to changing environmental conditions between 1980 and 2005, thereby contributing valuable insights for tailored conservation and restoration practices in the face of ongoing climate changes.

## About this notebook
Once you open this notebook you will clearly see that I was unable to get through the project.  I ran into issues from the beginning---My plan was to get a general bare bones model created and then expand upon that with functions that could work on multiple datasets.  I clearly have some work to do during this break and will continue to work on this so as to try and gain knowledge on the concepts.
